## Introduction
Welcome to the GTA Radio Project! This project aims to replicate the in-game radio experience from the popular video game series Grand Theft Auto (GTA). It allows fans to immerse themselves in the GTA universe by listening to the game's iconic licensed soundtracks, categorized by their corresponding games and radio stations. Additionally, it features radio hosts with their dialogues, as well as typical GTA-style commercials. Our goal is to bring a slice of the GTA universe to listeners wherever they go.

## Minimal Viable Product (MVP)
- **Offline Radio:** The core functionality is an offline radio that cycles through songs, radio host dialogues, and commercials without end.
- **Game and Radio Station Selection:** Users can select which game (ranging from GTA 2 to GTA V, including expansions like TBOGT & TLAD, GTA: SA, GTA: VC) and then choose a radio station.
- **Basic Controls:** The player includes simple controls to mute and unmute the audio.

## Nice to Haves
- **Global Accessibility:** We aim to make the project globally accessible while adhering to legal boundaries. This includes potentially using Spotify or Apple Music APIs for legal music playback.
- **Music Streaming Integration:** Options to sign in with Apple Music or Spotify, allowing users to listen to music while ensuring artists receive appropriate credit.
- **Multi-platform Support:** Compatibility with both iPhone and Android devices.
- **Integration Mockups:** Creating mockups for Apple Music and Spotify integrations, featuring an extra menu to play GTA Radio.

## Completion Criteria
The project will be considered complete when:
1. All features of the MVP are fully functional.
2. The GUI (Graphical User Interface) is fully styled and user-friendly.

## Notes
Please note that this project is a fan-made creation and is not affiliated with the official Grand Theft Auto games or their creators. It is crucial to ensure all aspects of the project comply with legal standards, especially concerning the use of licensed music and other copyrighted materials.
